   title: Distributed environment for neural network
   abstract: Deep Neural networks are inherently parallel in nature. Research is generally focused on the "going deeper" paradigm. More recent research is concentrated on "going wider" instead of just going deep.  
 
Wider paradigms have computational advantage since they can be executed concurrently in a distributed environment. They do not possess the constraint of data sharing between concurrent blocks.
