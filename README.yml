         Deep Neural networks are inherently parallel in nature. Research is
         generally focused on the going deeper paradigm. More recent research
         is concentrated on going wider instead of just going deep.  Wider paradigms
         have computational advantage since they, can be executed concurrently in
         a distributed environment. They do not possess the constraint of data sharing
         between concurrent blocks.
